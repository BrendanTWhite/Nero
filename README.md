# Nero
A watchOS app to help you care for aquariums

# Story

My son wanted an aquarium for his birthday. So we got a 40L salt water tank. But, it turns out that taking care of an aquarium is complex! Water chemistry is really important, and the smaller the volume, the more sensitive it is.

Of course, I immediately began thinking of ways to build a little tool to me with the maintainance and monitoring. Plus, I'e always wanted to experiment with watchOS. So, why not?

This is just an idea, for a toy tool, for a pretty niche problem. Real aquarists use fancy systems for automated monitoring of their tanks.

Nero comes from the greek word for water, νερό.

# Progress

Well, I guess I cannot say "zero", because I picked a name and made a repository. But, still, zero.

I'd love to hear from you! Get in touch via [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@mattiem), an issue, or a pull request.

I prefer collaboration, and would love to find ways to work together if you have a similar project.

I prefer indentation with tabs for improved accessibility. But, I'd rather you use the system you want and make a PR than hesitate because of whitespace.
